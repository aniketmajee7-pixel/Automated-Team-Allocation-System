# Automated-Team-Allocation-System
This is a Python-based algorithm to automate formation of balanced teams from a dataset of 6,000+ records, utilizing weighted heuristics and iterative local search to minimize CGPA deviation. Visualized success metrics using Matplotlib to demonstrate fair distribution of gender and school representation, validating algorithm's constraint satisfaction.

This project was for one of my School's requiremnts for a course. Could not have done it without my teamates, Junwei, Rishika, Siddhanth!
